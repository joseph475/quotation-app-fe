# Quotation Cache Fix

## Problem Description

The quotation application was experiencing a caching issue where:

1. A user with "user" role would create a quotation
2. After logout and login with an "admin" account
3. The quotation created by the user would not appear unless the browser cache was manually cleared

## Root Cause

The issue was caused by cached data persisting in localStorage between different user sessions. The application uses role-based and user-specific cache keys, but the logout process was only clearing authentication data, not the cached application data.

### Cache Key Structure

The application uses cache keys like:
- `quotations-admin-userId123`
- `quotations-user-userId456`
- `sales-admin-userId123`
- etc.

When switching between users, the old cached data remained in localStorage, causing the new user to see stale or incomplete data.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Cache Management Utilities (`src/utils/cacheHelpers.js`)

Added comprehensive cache management functions:

- `clearUserCache(userId, userRole)` - Clear cache for a specific user
- `clearAllAppCache()` - Clear all application cache (except auth data)
- `clearCacheByType(dataTypes)` - Clear cache for specific data types
- `getCacheStats()` - Get cache statistics for debugging

### 2. Enhanced Authentication Helpers (`src/utils/authHelpers.js`)

Added a new function `clearAuthUserAndCache()` that:
- Clears authentication data
- Clears all cached application data
- Clears sessionStorage markers

### 3. Updated Authentication Context (`src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx`)

Modified the login and logout processes to:
- Clear all cached data before login (prevents cross-contamination)
- Clear all cached data during logout (ensures clean slate for next user)

## Key Changes

### Cache Clearing Strategy

The fix implements an aggressive cache clearing strategy:

1. **On Login**: Clear all existing cache before authenticating new user
2. **On Logout**: Clear all cache to prevent data leakage
3. **On Auth Error**: Clear cache if authentication data is corrupted

### Cache Key Patterns

The cache clearing function identifies and removes keys that match:
- User-specific patterns: `*-${userRole}-${userId}`
- Application data patterns: `quotations-*`, `sales-*`, `customers-*`, etc.
- Session markers in sessionStorage

## Benefits

1. **Data Isolation**: Each user session starts with a clean cache
2. **Security**: Prevents data leakage between different user accounts
3. **Consistency**: Ensures users always see fresh, role-appropriate data
4. **Reliability**: Eliminates the need for manual cache clearing

## Testing

To verify the fix:

1. Login as a user role account
2. Create a quotation
3. Logout
4. Login as an admin role account
5. Navigate to quotations page
6. Verify that the quotation created by the user is visible to the admin

The quotation should now appear immediately without requiring manual cache clearing.

## Technical Details

### Cache Clearing Process

```javascript
// During logout/login
clearAuthUserAndCache() -> {
  clearAuthUser();           // Remove auth tokens
  clearAllAppCache();        // Remove all app data cache
  sessionStorage.clear();    // Clear session markers
}
```

### Cache Key Detection

The system identifies cache keys using patterns:
- Starts with known prefixes: `quotations-`, `sales-`, `customers-`, etc.
- Contains user identifiers: `-${userRole}-${userId}`
- Excludes auth and device keys to preserve security data

### Performance Impact

- Minimal performance impact as cache clearing only occurs during login/logout
- Fresh data fetch on first page visit ensures data accuracy
- Subsequent page visits within the session still benefit from caching

## Future Considerations

1. **Selective Cache Clearing**: Could implement more granular cache clearing based on user permissions
2. **Cache Versioning**: Could add cache versioning to handle schema changes
3. **Cache Monitoring**: Could add cache size monitoring and automatic cleanup
