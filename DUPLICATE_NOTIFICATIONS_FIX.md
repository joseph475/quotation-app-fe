# Duplicate Notifications Fix

## Problem
In production environment, users were receiving 2 notifications per 1 create of notification, but in local development it was working correctly with only 1 notification.

## Root Cause Analysis
The duplicate notifications were caused by several factors:

1. **Multiple WebSocket Connections**: In production, network instability or reconnection logic could establish multiple WebSocket connections simultaneously.

2. **Event Listener Re-registration**: The `useEffect` in `NotificationContext.jsx` had dependencies that could cause it to re-run and add duplicate event listeners without properly cleaning up the previous ones.

3. **Insufficient Deduplication**: The original deduplication logic using `processedQuotations.current` was only in-memory and could be bypassed by multiple connection instances.

4. **Race Conditions**: Multiple WebSocket messages could arrive simultaneously, bypassing the deduplication checks.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Notification Deduplication (`src/contexts/NotificationContext.jsx`)

- **Timestamp-based Keys**: Added timestamp to deduplication keys to make them more unique
- **localStorage Backup**: Store processed notification keys in localStorage as backup to in-memory tracking
- **State-level Duplicate Check**: Added additional check in `setNotifications` to prevent duplicates at the state level
- **Improved ID Generation**: Use more unique IDs for notifications combining timestamp and random string
- **Stable Dependencies**: Changed useEffect dependencies to be more stable (`[user?.id || user?._id, user?.role]`)

### 2. WebSocket Connection Management (`src/utils/realTimeSync.js`)

- **Connection State Tracking**: Added `isConnecting` flag to prevent multiple simultaneous connections
- **Proper Connection Cleanup**: Close existing connections before creating new ones
- **Reset Flags**: Properly reset `isConnecting` flag in all connection state handlers
- **Enhanced Logging**: Better logging for debugging connection issues

### 3. Key Changes Made

#### NotificationContext.jsx
```javascript
// Enhanced deduplication with timestamp and localStorage backup
const quotationId = data.quotationId || data._id || data.id;
const timestamp = data.timestamp || new Date().toISOString();
const processKey = `quotation_created_${quotationId}_${timestamp}`;

// Check both in-memory and localStorage for duplicates
const storageKey = `processed_notifications_${userId}`;
const storedProcessed = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(storageKey) || '[]');
const allProcessed = new Set([...processedQuotations.current, ...storedProcessed]);

// Additional state-level duplicate check
const existingNotification = prev.find(n => 
  n.type === 'quotation_created' && 
  n.data?.quotationId === quotationId &&
  Math.abs(new Date(n.timestamp) - new Date()) < 5000 // Within 5 seconds
);
```

#### realTimeSync.js
```javascript
// Prevent multiple simultaneous connections
if (this.isConnecting) {
  console.log('WebSocket connection already in progress');
  return;
}

// Close any existing connection before creating a new one
if (this.ws && this.ws.readyState !== WebSocket.CLOSED) {
  console.log('Closing existing WebSocket connection before reconnecting');
  this.ws.close();
  this.ws = null;
}

this.isConnecting = true;
```

## Testing
- Test in both local and production environments
- Create quotations and verify only one notification is received
- Test with network interruptions to ensure reconnection doesn't cause duplicates
- Monitor browser console for deduplication logs

## Monitoring
The fix includes extensive logging to help monitor and debug:
- `Duplicate notification prevented for quotation: [id]`
- `Duplicate notification found in state, skipping`
- `WebSocket connection already in progress`
- `Closing existing WebSocket connection before reconnecting`

## Future Considerations
1. Consider implementing server-side deduplication as an additional safety measure
2. Monitor localStorage usage to ensure it doesn't grow too large
3. Consider adding notification expiry to clean up old processed keys
4. Implement connection health monitoring dashboard for production
